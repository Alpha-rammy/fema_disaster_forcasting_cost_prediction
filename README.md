🌪️ TerraNova FEMA Disaster Cost Prediction


🎯 Overview


TerraNova is an end-to-end machine learning system designed to forecast FEMA disaster recovery costs using historical disaster declarations, public assistance funding records, and disaster impact indicators.


This project demonstrates production-grade data science practices including:

✅ Disaster Cost Forecasting using Machine Learning

✅ Feature Engineering (Temporal, Funding, Severity Features)

✅ Model Comparison (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

✅ Real-time Scoring API built with FastAPI

✅ Interactive Dashboard using Streamlit

✅ Automated Model Tracking with MLflow
✅ Production-Ready Project Structure
